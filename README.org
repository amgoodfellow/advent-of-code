* Layout

At the root of this project directory, there are separate folders for each year:

Inside each year, there are folders for each day following the format ~day-xx~

Inside of each day will be a folder for the language that that day's puzzle was completed in, as well as a folder for puzzle inputs. Often the language will be Rust, but there might be different languages for each day. I think AoC is fun for seeing how different languages nudge you in different directions. Each Rust solution will be a full cargo project, just because I think it's more convenient than breaking things into workspaces.
